# Environmental Monitoring & Pollution Control – Week 2

This project builds on the Week 1 milestone by performing deeper analysis on environmental pollution data.

## Week 2 Milestone
- Reused the Week 1 dataset (`sample_environment_dataset.csv`).
- Performed AQI trend analysis over time for different cities.
- Added pollutant correlation analysis using a heatmap.
- Visualized how pollutants relate to Air Quality Index (AQI).
- Generated new insights about which locations are most polluted and which pollutants impact AQI the most.

## Tools & Libraries
- Python
- Pandas
- Matplotlib
- Seaborn
- Jupyter Notebook

## Files
- `Week2_Project.ipynb` → Jupyter Notebook with analysis & visualizations
- `sample_environment_dataset.csv` → Sample dataset used for Week 1 & 2

## Insights
- AQI varies significantly across cities, with some showing higher peaks over time.
- PM2.5 and PM10 are strongly correlated with AQI, confirming they are major contributors to air pollution.
- Correlation heatmap provides evidence of pollutant interdependence.
